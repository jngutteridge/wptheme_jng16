### Installation ###

This project uses Node to manage frontend dependencies. Node is multiplatform and very easy to install and manage. Install Node and NPM on your machine before compiling the frontend assets. With Node installed, you need to run the following command from the project's root directory:

    npm install && npm run build


You can then have Gulp watch and compile on changes. To do this use the command:

	npm run watch

This project is also integrated with LiveReload. With LiveReload, changes can take effect in the browser without having to refresh or reload a page or asset.

This project uses the following technologies:

  * Jade for building PHP files
  * Sourcemaps for dev only
  * Sass with SCSS format
  * PostCSS for build only
      * Autoprefixer
      * PixREM
      * CSSWring
  * LiveReload
